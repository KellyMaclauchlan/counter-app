coin counting app
This is an app I made designed to count money, in the forms of bills and coins based off Canadian currency.
The user simply presses the button of that denomination every time they come across it. The app shows both the
monetary value of the money counted but also how many of each denomination has been imputed.

In the future I plan to add a button that will clear the values and undo the last value places and possibly more
as an undo feature.
